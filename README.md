# BIT271_AppProposal
Proposed app design and jquery prototype for Cascadia College's BIT271 class

This is a proposal for a supplemental tool that helps clients track and organize their goals, progress and thoughts 
outside of therapy sessions.The working title right now is "Headspace", but it will be changed to something 
more appropriate as time continues. 

Intended Audience: While the app is intended for people who are currently in or have previously attended therapy, 
it’s widely available to anyone recovery-oriented who’s looking for a tool to help keep their goals and priorities 
organized.
